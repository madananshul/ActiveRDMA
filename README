The current version uses separate bin/ and src/

FIXME tags point to stuff that needs/should be improved in future versions (Eclipse has a way of tracking this).

The src/tests uses JUnit (again Eclipse includes this by default but you may need to have junit.jar in your classpath otherwise).

P.S. Commits by '746 User' are by madananshul, TBD - Add appropriate user in my Linux VM.
