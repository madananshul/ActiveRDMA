Previous version should all be in old/

New version uses separate bin/ and src/ (did the old one also use this?)
So the code is expected to read .class from bin/ and not the source.

FIXME tags point to stuff that needs/should be improved in future versions (Eclipse has a way of tracking this).

The src/tests uses JUnit (again Eclipse includes this by default but you may need to have junit.jar in your classpath otherwise).
