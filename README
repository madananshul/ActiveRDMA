The current version uses separate bin/ and src/

FIXME tags point to stuff that needs/should be improved in future versions (Eclipse has a way of tracking this).

The src/tests uses JUnit (again Eclipse includes this by default but you may need to have junit.jar in your classpath otherwise).

TBD - During 'touch' file gets created, but an EFAULT is returned to the linux client.(NullpointerException) problem with utimensat & utimes??

TBD - Add support for directories - change getattr, getdir, mkdir

TBD - atim/mtime/ctime not handled yet.

TBD - unlink(for swap file) 

TBD - Current FUSE code sometimes calls upto 2 DFS ActiveRDMA calls at a time(the extra call being to lookup), once Objects can be stored via ActiveRDMA, change this to single DFS syscall.

The current build.xml file is broken, use 'make' to compile the project.
TBD - Fix build.xml

Error no. 524 - Unsupported operation(I guess by FUSEJ)

P.S. Commits by '746 User' are by madananshul, TBD - Add appropriate user in my Linux VM.

Instructions to run FUSE client + Java App prototype :

    * ./arfs_mount.sh /tmp/active_rdma(This will mount and start logging in terminal 1)
