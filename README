The current version uses separate bin/ and src/

FIXME tags point to stuff that needs/should be improved in future versions (Eclipse has a way of tracking this).

The src/tests uses JUnit (again Eclipse includes this by default but you may need to have junit.jar in your classpath otherwise).

TBD - Current FUSE code sometimes calls upto 2 DFS ActiveRDMA calls at a time(the extra call being to lookup), once Objects can be stored via ActiveRDMA, change this to single DFS syscall.

The current build.xml file is broken, use 'make' to compile the project.
TBD - Fix build.xml

P.S. Commits by '746 User' are by madananshul, TBD - Add appropriate user in my Linux VM.
