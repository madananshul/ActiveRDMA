* An icon is a rectangular patch of bits.  It has a size: (rows,    *
* cols); an origin: (orow, ocol); and a displacement vector	    *
* (rdelt, cdelt).  The patch of bits is pointed to by `bits' and    *
* is an offset; this is done so that files containing icons can be  *
* read in and used directly.  The origin is a distinguished point   *
* within the icon.  It is used to define the tip of a pointer or    *
* the left endpoint of the baseline of a character.  The delta	    *
* defines the spacing from one origin to the next when a row of	    *
* icons is being laid out.					    *
