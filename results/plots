* performance: wallclock time ( --> MB/s for streaming)
  { NFS, ARFS-r, ARFS-a }

* performance: roundtrips
  { NFS, ARFS-r, ARFS-a }

* CPU load
  jvm_nsec, insns for 1, 5 datapoints in scale experiment

* RDMA vs. active
  synthetic plot of total latency as jvm_nsec + roundtrips*latency
  { ARFS-r, ARFS-a }
